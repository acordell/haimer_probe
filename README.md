Use a Haimer 3D Taster probe and webcam as a LinuxCNC probe

Using machine vision to read the dial of a mechanical 3d probe, an electronic probe is created for LinuxCNC.

A Microsoft LifeCam Cinema webcam is attached to a Haimer 3D Taser with a 3d printed part. The software monitors the two hands of the dial face, presenting debug views, and returning the combined value of the two dials. Keyboard commands begin edge probing and circle center locating.
