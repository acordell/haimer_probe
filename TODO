* Change haimer_camera.py to use a different interface than the numeric keys to control the direction of movement. These in conflict with entering the plate size of z_camera.py. Maybe an on screen dialog? At the very least, have a keyboard command for "start seeking, press a numeric key"
* What methods are shared between the two cameras? The error message drawing code is one.
* Sometimes, there is oscillation around the gauge reading 0 (solved now or just reduced?)
* Would be nice to have a moving point on the z_camera view showing the position of the probe tip.
