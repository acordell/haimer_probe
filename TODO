1. change haimer_camera.py to use a different interface than the numeric keys to control the direction of movement. These in conflict with entering the plate size of z_camera.py. Maybe an on screen dialog?
2. copy the new error string code into z_camera.py. Maybe have it in a module that's included. What other shared methods are there?
3. sometimes, there is oscillation around the gauge reading 0 (solved now or just reduced?)
